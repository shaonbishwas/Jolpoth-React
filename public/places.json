The market is surrounded by vast guava orchards—the largest in Asia—stretching across Jhalokati, Barishal, and Pirojpur districts. About 20,000 families from 26 villages depend on this orchard, spread over 31,000 acres, for their livelihoods. From dawn to dusk, the market buzzes with activity. Fruit growers load their boats, seeking buyers. The boats, almost identical in design and size, create a mesmerizing visual pattern. As you stand on the small bridge overlooking the canal, the scene unfolds—a harmonious chaos reminiscent of Thailand’s floating markets or Venice’s waterways. Houses, schools, and bridges line the shores, adding to the enchantment. During heavy downpours, the surroundings come alive. Raindrops dance on the water, and the market takes on a mystical quality. Although the market operates year-round, it truly comes alive during guava season. July and August witness a flurry of activity as farmers ferry their produce to the market. August, with its abundant guava harvest, is the ideal time to visit. Arrive before 11 am to witness the bustling crowd. When guava season wanes, hog plum takes center stage. The market continues to thrive."
