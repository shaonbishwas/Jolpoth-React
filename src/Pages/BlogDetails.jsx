          Welcome to riverine country. Bangladesh is braided together by more
          than 700 rivers, producing a deliciously lush landscape with more
          shades of green than you ever imagined. Travelling by boat is a way of
          life here, and provides a fabulous opportunity to see the country from
          a more unusual angle. This is one of the world’s most densely
          populated countries, but once you’re slowly floating downriver on a
          small wooden rowboat, it’s easy to imagine you have it all to
          yourself. Whether you're travelling to hectic Dhaka or to the
          Sundarbans' mangrove forests, boats large and small will help you
          explore Bangladesh's riches. Welcome to riverine country. Bangladesh
